# QWERTY UK Mac Keyboard Layout for WIndows

This installs a keyboard layout in Windows that aligns with the Mac Keyboard layout in the United Kingdom. This includes Option+2 for € and Option+3 for #.

The installer was created using Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator, and has been tested using a Logitech MX Keys for Mac. Your mileage may vary.

**This does not change the Windows shortcuts and hotkeys to the Mac equivalents**; i.e. Ctrl+C is still copy, rather than CMD+C. (A good tool for this is [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/). A helpful starting place is [here](https://github.com/stroebjo/autohotkey-windows-mac-keyboard).) 



## Installation

1.  Download the zip / clone the repo. (If you downloaded the zip, extract the files)
2.  Run setup.exe
3.  Grant the app admin permission to install
4.  Open the Settings app.
5.  Go to Time & Language.
6.  Select the Language tab.
7.  Select the current language.
8.  Click the keyboard button under it.
9.  The current and new keyboard layout will be listed. Remove the one you do not want to use.

## Known Issues

- This keyboard layout does not include characters that are typically accessed via Ctl+Alt or AltGr. Nor does it include the mac equivalents (apart from Option+2 for € and Option+3 for #. These work!)
